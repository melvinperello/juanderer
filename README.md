An application that will track and record user's location data, that will allow the application to intelligently guest where the user is going and prompt notifications accordingly.


The Philippines is a developing nation with a great problem in its mass transportation infrastructure. **Juanderer** will help the ordinary citizen to track down his/her daily routine while on the road.


The application should provide the user with:
